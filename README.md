Serial Image Grabber
===

*grabs a collection of images from a web server*

Usage
---
Enter a url pattern in the search field of the extension and press enter. The extension will compile separate image urls
from the pattern and display the images in a new browser tab.

For example, if you enter the url pattern **http://www.somewebsite.com/image_[003-005].png** and press enter, a new
tab will open up and display these images below each other:
<ul>
<li>http://www.somewebsite.com/image_003.png
<li>http://www.somewebsite.com/image_004.png
<li>http://www.somewebsite.com/image_005.png
</ul>
This a great way for displaying all the images of a particular house on a housing site for instance. Many news sites
also number their images by series, but not all of them. Just right click on a website's image to look at the url of
that image and you'll find out quick enough.
